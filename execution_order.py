    Parse the trace lines and extract the function call/return order.

    The parser looks for lines like:
       P_HDR Event: ... Function: <functionName>
    It then merges consecutive duplicate events (which occur when a functionâ€™s
    block is split into multiple events due to a maximum block size).
    Finally, it simulates a call stack:
      - When a new function appears that is not the current top of the stack,
        it is considered an "enter" (a call).
      - When a function reappears that is already in the stack (but not on top),
        that is taken as a return (pop inner calls) back to that function.
